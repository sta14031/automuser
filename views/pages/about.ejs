    <p>My name is Tyler Starr &ndash; welcome to my project!
    </p>

    <p>AutoMuser is my senior project for my
        bachelor&apos;s degree at
        <a href="https://byui.edu">BYU-Idaho.</a> The idea was born
        when I thought about two of my interests: coding and
        music. So here, we have a computer program that can
        generate music! The program itself consists of a
        series of Python scripts, and uses the library
        <a href="https://github.com/wybiral/python-musical">python-musical</a>
        to generate sound. All the code for this project is
        <a href="https://github.com/sta14031/automuser">open source</a>.
    </p>

<div class="text">
    <p>One way we might generate music dynamically is by using
        machine learning. This technique allows a program to study
        examples of existing music and learn to mimic them, thus
        producing original music after (hopefully) learning how
        music works from some existing examples.
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SacogDL_4JU">
        &quot;Computer evolves to generate baroque music!&quot;</a>
        is a project where music is generated in this way.
    </p>

    <p>However, one of my goals for this project was to generate
        music algorithmically. I wanted to have a clear procedure
        that we can look to and understand what makes music sound
        the way that it does. <a href="https://marasmusine.itch.io/duncs-algomusic">
        Dunc&apos;s Algomusic</a> is one project that does just that.
        But another goal of the project was to make <i>aesthetically pleasant</i>
        music according to the rules of 12-tone western harmony. I used
        random chord progressions, melodies, and rhythms to create new,
        original music each time. Hopefully, each song sounds different
        enough from the next. I also applied random voicings to the chord
        progressions for just a little more variation. All of the elements
        come together to create <i>randomly generated harmony</i>.
        I also relied upon patterns, with the idea that repetition would
        cause the music to be percieved as being more beautiful.
    </p>

    <p>So, have I succeeded?
        <a href="/">Try creating your very own music</a>! All you need is
        just one word or phrase for inspiration, and AutoMuser does
        the rest.
